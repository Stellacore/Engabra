\brief Main package include file (equivalent alternative to \<engabra.hpp\>)

This file simply includes "engabra.hpp". It is provided solely as an
option for public interface style. E.g. when preferring to include
the package as:

	#include <Engabra>

instead of

	#include <engabra.hpp>

Either approach is functionally equivalent.
