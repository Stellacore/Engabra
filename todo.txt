CMake

	- decide naming for install package (e.g. add version number?)
	- test/main programs include "Engabra/g3..."? or just "g3..."?
	- cmake config file dir naming
	- library tree directory use (perhaps like TPQZ?)

Naming

	- file naming in general

Documentation

	- everything

Coding

	- need multivector arithmetic
