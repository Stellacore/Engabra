Action List:

	- Complete g3ops port
		- unit tests
		- move functions from g3.hpp



CMake

	- decide naming for install package (e.g. add version number?)
	- test/main programs include "Engabra/g3..."? or just "g3..."?
	- cmake config file dir naming
	- library tree directory use (perhaps like TPQZ?)

Naming

	- file naming in general

Documentation

	- describe concept of using const instances e.g.
		Vector const foo{};
		not doing (foo = bar;, foo[1]=3.; etc)

	- everything
	- doxygen generation as part of build process

	https://gist.github.com/francesco-romano/351a6ae457860c14ee7e907f2b0fc1a5

Coding

	- need multivector arithmetic

	- Case: Should use (Complex and Dirplex) or (ComPlex and DirPlex) but
	not both. (or ComPlex and AntPlex for commutitive and anti-commutative?)


Thoughts and Ideas (while coding
GravitySpatial/HorizontalAngle EvalHoriAngleDiffs.cpp)


would be nice to have a wedge(a,b) that uses antiCommProduct directly
 (not waste time computing scalar).
 e.g. maybe like wedgeVecVec(x,x);

Perhaps have .g0(), .g1(), .g2(), .g3() grade selection methods?

Consider convenience function collections - e.g. g3angles (and other such).
e.g. shortAngleBetween(), longAngleBeteen(), 1D,2D families of angles, etc.
