# Example uses of <projectNameHere>


## Photogrammetry/Computer Vision

	- Optical system distortion model?

## Computer Graphics and Animation

### Rotation Interpolation

	- Rotation interpolation - slerp kind of things...
		- e.g. bivector interpolation functions

### Kinematics

	- integration of rotation sensors from smart device


## Engineering

### Survey

	- angle between two sightings (body motion, dir recovery, angle compute)

	- space intersection computation

### Geodesy

	- shortest path distance on surface of a sphere?

### Statics

	- solution for forces on a ladder

	- numeric solution for tension in a truss member?

    - Forces and moments on a beam


## Physics

### Gravity solution

	- generative bridge design on binary/trinary asteroid

	- orbiting dumb-bells around spherical body


## Math

### Fractals

	- Mandelbrot like iterations

	- E.g. perhaps: x' = k2*exp(k1(ln(X) - A)) - C
		- k1: Real (integer?)
		- k2: Real
		- A: Angle (generalized) angular-element
		- C: Linel (generalized) linear-element
		- X: Morphor (generalized rotor)
